Climate: Warm Desert

Domain: Multicellula
Kingdom: Noncongitandi
Phylum: Florentum
Class: Carospinosa
Order: Follisfluctuans

Description: Follisfluctuans resemble large thorny balloons, drifting along air currents using the fictional process of [[Vehemensvisgeneratio]]. This process is modified slightly to also produce helium which is what allows the Follisfluctuans to float.. Instead of having thorns like others of its class, Follisfluctuans instead radiates the small amount of radiation created in the constant production of helium. It uses this helium to propel itself towards water holes, where they then drop down and absorb water through their hanging roots. They rapidly grow heavy foul tasting nuts while sitting in pools of water that they drop before ascending.
