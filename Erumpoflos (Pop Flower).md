Climate: Marshland

Domain: Multicellula
Kingdom: Noncongitandi
Phylum: Florentum
Class: Indomitaherba
Order: Erumpoflos

Description: Erumpoflos grow in nearly any shallow water that isn't frozen and can be found growing along many river beds and around many lakes outside of the marshland they are most prolific in. They grow numerous long stalks with fist sized bulbs clustered at the end. Each bulb is filled with air and loose grains, serving as a keystone food sources for the environments they're found in. Erumpoflos are nearly impossible to kill, growing deep taproots with several rhizomes that regrow the surface plant when destroyed. When they are pollenated they inject a large burst of air from the stem into the bulbs causing them to burst, spreading their light grains throughout the surrounding area. Erumpflos also uses the frequent storms in marshland areas to propagate, where the strong winds carry the bulbs far away from the parent plant.
