Climate: Savanna

Domain: Multicellula
Kingdom: Noncongitandi
Phylum: Florentum
Class: Longusherba
Order: Radiusignifier

Description: One of the most prolific plants across the savanna, the Radiusignifier grows thin stalks upwards in dense clusters. They branch out and grow tough nuts at the end of their stalks, when exposed to intense heat the nuts explode, firing out seeds that grow into entirely new plants. The seeds can be dangerous however the heat causing the seeds to explode is often far more dangerous. Radiusignifier has deep taproots making it almost impossible to dislodge once they've taken hold, however their method of spreading limits them to areas frequented by wildfires.
