Description: Gigaconcha are giant anosteus, growing up to 10 feet in height at older ages. They are primarily defenseless however they produce a unique mucus that erodes most stones. This allows them to hollow out boulders to carry on their backs in defense, not being like true snails that grow shells themselves. Shells that Gigaconcha grow out of are used by smaller fauna as shelters and homes. During winter periods when the temperature is lower the Gigaconcha enter a hibernative state, ceasing all body functions until warmer weather thaws them from this state. There is a relatively low population of Gigaconcha due to their high nutrient requirements and long life span. They have no natural predators and live peaceful lives slowly traversing their forests, consuming grains, cleaning up carcasses, and bathing in water. When a Gigaconcha dies its carcass is highly nutrient rich and acts as a premium fertilizer, causing rapid plant growth in the surrounding area.
