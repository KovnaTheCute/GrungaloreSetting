Description: Caelumparalysis are nocturnal, with incredibly sharp vision they strike prey with devastating speed before swooping back up and waiting for their venom to take effect. Their venom is among the most venomous on the planet, with a LD50 of 0.01mg/kg they inject 100mg of venom per sting. Victims of their venom have all of their organs paralyzed, causing near instant death. They can reach speeds up to 100km/hr when diving and are extremely streamlined to reach such speeds.
