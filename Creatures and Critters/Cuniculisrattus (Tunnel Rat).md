Description: Cunicullisrattus are small rodents that have exceptional hearing due to their large ears. They are nearly impossible to surprise, especially due to their high alertness when outside their extensive tunnel systems. Cunicullisrattus breed constantly and each tunnel system can extend for miles, containing herds of tens to hundreds of rodents. They eat various roots for food, occasionally scavenging nuts and fruits from the surface when going to drink water. They are fast and their tunnel systems are used by many small animals of the savanna to evade prey and the sun. Few travel deep into them as the tunnels are mazes and only the Cuniculisrattus has exceptional enough memory to not get lost traversing them.
