Family: Cortextesta

Diet: Tree sap

Description: Cortextesta have large white thorax's that are fairly soft, with exception of the hard flat end they use to scrape bark. They feed on the sap from trees, primarily the Pilasuseums. They also use this sap as an adhesive, stripping bark off of trees and attaching it to their thorax, providing camouflage and protection. Their horn is sharp and is used in sparing with other males and for poking holes into tree bark to drink sap. Older adults have thick layers of bark, slowly crawling across trees adding tough bark to their shell.
