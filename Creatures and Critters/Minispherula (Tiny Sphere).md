Description: Minispherula are small and unintelligent. They bumble around the waters they exist in seeking out food, often bouncing off of each other and the environment. They are rotund and spherical, measuring no wider then 3cm when fully grown. They flail their small fins wildly to navigate. They travel in social groups of as many minispherula as possible however there is no communication and no mating rituals beyond the basic instincts to stay together. Groups of Minispherula resemble a large collection of bubbles, moving around in a similar manner. They simply breed and eat, making them a keystone food source for other fauna in their environment. If left completely alone without predators they can destroy the balance of entire ecosystems, Quickly breeding and consuming with no restraint.
