Order: Rupisstaticus

Description: Rupisstaticus makes it's home primarily on the forest floor of the rainforests of Pulchseria. The moss forms large carpets that extend wrinkled blades outwards, up to two or three inches long. These blades sway back and forth building up static charge from the highly humid environment, storing it within the body of the moss. When something comes into contact with the moss it releases all of its stored charge, with longer periods storing larger amounts of charge. The moss then secretes a digestive fluid onto the now deceased creature that lays on top of it and begins absorbing as much nutrients as it can. Scavengers that try to steal its prey are often met with electrical charges themselves, allowing its hunting mechanism to also serve as defense.
