Order: Milleparvaespinae

Description: Milleparvaespinae seem to be completely smooth, storing water inside of themselves similar to any other cacti of the Carospinosa class. Their spines are microscopic and number in the millions per square inch of flesh, leading to them being on no animals diet. Creatures that come into contact with Milleparvaespinae break out with terrible microscopic lactations that cause immense pain, often causing the victim to pass out. Creatures that are unlucky enough to consume the flesh of Milleparvaspinae face excruciating death by internal bleeding, as the thorns ravage the internal organs of the victim. Milleparvaespinae don't tend to grow very large, only measuring a few feet when fully grown. Their flowers create an incredibly appetizing nectar and large petals that flow out to protect pollinators from its thorns.
