Description: Sanguisugaculmus is an example of a plant that has evolved to use basic magic to suit its needs. The base of the grass is a large rhizome that stores water and nutrients. The rhizome is highly fire resilient and is incredibly tough. From the rhizome the grass rapidly grows long durable thorn covered leaves that grow upwards in a tangled mess. Sanguisugaculmus grows extremely appetizing smelling berries, with the goal of drawing creatures blood on the thorns. Once it absorbs blood into its leaves it uses a magic organ in its rhizome to transmute the blood into water and nutrients, which it uses to grow more berries. Each Sanguisugaculmus can grow up to 4 ft. tall and can reach out upwards of 2 ft., often growing fairly spaced out from one another as large fields steal prey from one another. Due to the constant transmutations happening within the plants, large fields of them that do manage to survive can form loose connections to the other planes, allowing planar beings to slip through.
