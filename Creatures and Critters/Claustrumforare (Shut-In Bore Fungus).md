Domain: Multicellula
Kingdom: Agaricus
Phylum: Mentisfractor
Class: Formido
Order: Claustrumforare

Description: Claustrumforare bore into the bark of Pilasuseum trees and gain their nutrients directly from the adhesive sap within. They appear as large spherical fungi with an amber hue. Due to the adhesiveness of the sap and the toughness of the bark, Claustrumforare are incredibly difficult to remove from their host trees. When they are broken they release a cloud of spores, serving both as a means of defense and reproduction. The spores produce a psychedelic effect that induce intense claustrophobia when inhaled. This effect can last for hours and is potentially lethal as animals under its effect tend to thrash around violently as if trying to escape a confined space. This often leads to creatures breaking open additional Claustrumforare bulbs, releasing more spores. Claustrumforare is able to regrow broken bulbs after they are burst, only dying when the bore roots themselves are damaged.
