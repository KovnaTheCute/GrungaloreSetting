Class: Unarumus
Order: Solumsitula

Description: Solumsitula are composed of three major parts: Long roots that tether it into the ground, thick fire resistant bark that takes a wide spherical form and has a hollow inside to store excess water, and its large leaves that form a huge funnel atop its trunk. Solumsitula collects water during rain season through its roots and its leaves and stores it within its trunk. It is able to close off the top of its trunk so that the water remains inside, forming an air tight container that prevents the water from escaping. In the event of a fire the Solumsitula will often only lose its leaves, its bark possessing extremely fire resilient sap that protects the rest of the tree and the water inside. They produce a hard, bitter tasting nut that falls to the ground once it is grown.
