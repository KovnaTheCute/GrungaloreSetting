Description: Funalefructus trees grow high up into the canopy with thick branches and large leaves. They grow long sturdy vines straight downwards from their branches hanging down, sometimes all the way to the forest floor. At the bottom of each vine the tree grows a sweet tasting fruit that branches off in six directions, each tip producing a bioluminescent glow that emits a mild amount of light. Each tip contains a seed that can grow into a new Funalefructus tree.
