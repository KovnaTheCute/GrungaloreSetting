Order: Stagnumconopeum

Description: Stagnumconopeum grows in shallow water sources such as rivers and ponds. They grow wide heavy leaves that overlap and form a dense cover over the water they grow in, creating a cool environment beneath them that protects the water from the heat of the sun. They are nutritionally dense and foster entire ecosystems around them. When blooming they hang bright blue flowers from their ends that absorb excessive amounts of heat in close proximity to them. Using the heat as energy to release a pollen outwards away from the water. The area around the flowers has a tendency to become freezing, further cooling the area beneath the grass.
