Description: Arundinisagricola are tall with large webbed feet that disperse their surprisingly light weight enough to prevent them from sinking into the mud of the marshland. Their front and rear leg pairing are used for traversal wheras their two center limbs have complex hands that they use to manipulate their environment. Arundinisagricola grow to be up to 10 feet tall and form herds with strong social structures. They use their central limbs to manipulate reeds and sticks to build dams and short walls, as well as to improve growing conditions for their food source such as by clearing overhead foliage or picking invasive plants. They are highly intelligent and form fairly large social groups consisting of 15 - 30 Arundinisagricola in larger groups. Arundinisagricola mate for life, raising their young to adulthood. They rarely travel out of their social groups with exception of seeking to form a new group or in the case of an exile. When threatened they either use their large webbed feet to attempt to drown the threat or they throw sharpened sticks and rocks until the threat leaves to find other prey.
