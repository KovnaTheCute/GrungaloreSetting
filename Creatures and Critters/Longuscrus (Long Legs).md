Description: Longuscrus can grow up to 30 ft. tall in their adulthood. Two long muscular legs hold them up and allow them to sprint at extremely high speeds, escaping nearly all predators in outright chases. They use their high stature to drink water from open Solumsitula trees, and their main food source is the leaves from said trees as well as leaves from other trees in the monsoon regions. During period of food scarcity they lower themselves to feed on shrubs and grasses however this leaves them vulnerable and they generally avoid it when possible. They tend to avoid conflict however when threatened they are not adverse to stomping predators into the ground in defense. Their mating ritual consists of two males balancing themselves one a single leg, and kicking at one another until one falls over.
