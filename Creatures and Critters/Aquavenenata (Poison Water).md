Description: Aquavenenata Juveniles will seek out water sources and bloat themselves, mixing a mild poison that they themselves are immune to to dissuade predators. This often doesn't work as the poison isn't lethal except in extreme doses and more often then not leads to a mild stomach ache. They have not had to evolve this out however as they breed in such massive quantities that significant amounts survive each season. Adults gain the benefits of flight along with long proboscises that they use to pierce cacti flesh so they can feed upon the water inside, no longer needing to store as much inside of themselves. Both stages of Aquavenenata are vital food sources for desert ecosystems.
