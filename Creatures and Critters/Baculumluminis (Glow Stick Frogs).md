Decsription: Baculumluminis gain bioluminescent properties from the chandelier fruits that make up the majority of their diet. They are typically between two to three inches large when fully grown however larger species do exist. They are nocturnal and as such they use their bioluminescence as their primary form of communication, sending advanced patterns and signals across their body to communicate with others of their family. They also use their displays for defense. When threatened they croak, making an extremely loud cracking sound followed by a burst of light from their bodies, disorientating the threat so they can escape. Baculumluminis live in familial structures and are fairly intelligent, able to remember and navigate a large area of rainforest, as well as construct complex nests and burrows.
