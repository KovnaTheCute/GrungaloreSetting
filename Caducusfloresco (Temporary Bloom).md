Class: Pacificusauctus
Order: Caducusfloresco

Description: Caducusfloresco is one of the few Pacificusauctus that is seasonal, rapidly growing and shrinking depending on the temperature of its environment. Caducusfloresco can grow as tall as 20 feet in the span of only a few weeks and last for a few months until the nutrient cost of maintaining its impressive form outweighs that created through a process similar to photosynthesis called [[Vehemensvisgeneratio]]. Caducusfloresco consist of two major components, a dense energy efficient mycelium network that allows it to store and share nutrients with other Caducusfloresco, and the large seasonal growth that the Caducusfloresco uses to photosynthesize. The mycelium network extends far below where the ground freezes during the winter, allowing the Caducusfloresco to grow again in mid spring, when the weather is consistently warmer and daylight is longer. The growth is highly nutrient rich and has organs to facilitate a highly efficient version of photosynthesis that makes Caducusfloresco a keystone food source for its environment, being incredibly nutrient dense and generating far more nutrients then it needs.
