Vehemenvisgeneratio is a fictional process of highly efficient photosynthesis that is extremely specific and far more delicate. Cells used for Vehemensvisgeneratio are significantly more fragile, flammable, and have significantly higher chances of mutating or becoming cancerous. Cells that undergo Vehemensvisgeneratio take in significantly more water and CO2 and output vast amounts of O2, often in large enough quantities that a gust of wind is created. Additionally the reaction, as unstable as it is, also generates radiation that permeates from the cells, increasing the mutation chance of surrounding cells.
