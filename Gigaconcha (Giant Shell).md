Description: Gigaconcha are giant anosteus, growing up to 10 feet in height at older ages. They are primarily defenseless however they produce a unique mucus that erodes most stones. This allows them to hollow out boulders to carry on their backs in defense, not being like true snails that grow shells themselves. During winter periods when the temperature is lower the Gigaconcha enter a hibernative state, ceasing all body functions and effectively dying until warmer weather thaws them from this state.
