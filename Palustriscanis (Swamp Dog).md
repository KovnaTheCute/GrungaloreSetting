Description: Palustriscanis are partially arboreal and partially aquatic, breathing through lungs as a member of the Terraspiriare phylum. They have short snouts that allow them to completely close off their nostrils, being able to hold their breath for up to an hour at a time. They have webbed feet that they use for aquatic navigation along with strong and sharp claws that they use to climb and hunt. They have complex social calls and communicate information between packs regarding dangers, threats, food sources, and environment. Their primary food source is larger prey that the pack can work together to hunt down. There is significant gender dimorphism amongst this species, with males having much more vibrant webbing and fins while females are larger with more muted colors. Palustriscanis mate for life, spitting off from their packs to raise between 2 and 6 young.
